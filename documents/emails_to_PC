Dear {PC_member},

First of all, thank you for being part of the program committee for the CCIW'19 workshop. As the CCIW'19 submission deadline is approaching, we would like to ask you to disseminate the CfP (attached at the end of this email) as much as you can. 

Also, we would like to remind you that you are very much encouraged to submit recent and novel work (or preliminary research) that could spark interesting discussions at the workshop. 

We are working on making a very fruitful workshop this year.

Thank you and best regards,
Bogdan Nicolae
